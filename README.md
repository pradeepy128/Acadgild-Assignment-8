Task 1
Create a Scala application to find the GCD of two numbers

Task 2
Fibonacci series (starting from 1) written in order without any spaces in between, thus producing a sequence of digits.
Write a Scala application to find the Nth digit in the sequence.
➢ Write the function using standard for loop
➢ Write the function using recursion

Task 3
Find square root of number using Babylonian method.
1. Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the root, the better).
2.Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
b) Set y = n/x

Task 4
Create a calculator to work with rational numbers.
Requirements:
➢ It should provide capability to add, subtract, divide and multiply rational Numbers
➢ Create a method to compute GCD (this will come in handy during operations on rational)
Add option to work with whole numbers which are also rational numbers i.e. (n/1)
➢ achieve the above using auxiliary constructors
➢ enable method overloading to enable each function to work with numbers and rational.
